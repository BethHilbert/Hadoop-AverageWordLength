# Hadoop-MapReduce - Shakespeare

MapReduce code which calculates average word length by letter. This repository includes the Driver, Mapper, and Reducer. Also included in this repository is a txt file with the local and Hadoop script commands necessary to complile, combine, and submit the project.

This MapReduce code could be used on any HDFS directory. I used it on a sample of Shakespeare's works provided by Cloudera. I included the Reducer's output as a csv file, showing key-value format.
